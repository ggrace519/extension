## 🎉 Credits & Acknowledgments

This extension is built on top of the excellent work by the [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) project. Open WebUI is an extensible, feature-rich, and user-friendly self-hosted WebUI designed to operate entirely offline. It supports various LLM runners, including Ollama, OpenAI, and more.

**Original Project**: [open-webui/extension](https://github.com/open-webui/extension)  
**Open WebUI**: [open-webui/open-webui](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui)

## ✨ Enhancements in This Fork

This fork includes several security and feature enhancements:

### 🔐 Security Enhancements

- **API Key Encryption**: API keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before storage, providing an additional layer of security beyond Chrome's built-in storage encryption
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented sensible rate limits to prevent API abuse:
  - Chat completions: 10 requests per minute
  - Model fetching: 5 requests per minute
  - General API calls: 20 requests per minute
- **SSRF Protection**: URL validation prevents Server-Side Request Forgery attacks
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized before being sent to APIs
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: CSP configured and validated for secure content loading
- **Message Action Validation**: Strict validation of all messages between content scripts and background worker
- **Comprehensive Security Documentation**: See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for detailed security information

### 🚀 Feature Enhancements

- **Conversation History**: Full conversation history with context preservation for multi-turn interactions
- **Follow-up Questions**: Ask follow-up questions directly in the response popup without starting a new conversation
- **Response Popup**: Dedicated popup modal for AI responses with streaming display
- **Copy Conversation**: One-click copy of entire conversation history
- **Improved Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages, especially for rate limit violations
- **Better UX**: Auto-focus on input fields, improved keyboard shortcuts, and smoother interactions

### 📋 Technical Improvements

- **Better Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of extension context invalidation
- **Improved DOM Timing**: Better handling of DOM readiness for content script injection
- **Enhanced Keyboard Shortcuts**: More reliable shortcut handling using Chrome's Commands API
- **Streaming Response Improvements**: Better handling of streaming AI responses with proper cleanup

For a complete list of security features and implementation details, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run check` - Run Svelte type checking

### Development Tips

- After building, always reload the extension in Chrome to see changes
- Check the browser console for any errors
- The extension uses Chrome Storage API for configuration persistence
- Content scripts are injected into all pages (`<all_urls>`)

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading

- Ensure you've built the extension (`npm run build` in the `extension/` directory)
- Check that `extension/dist/main.js` and `extension/dist/style.css` exist
- Verify you're loading the correct directory (the one with `manifest.json`)

### API Connection Issues

- Verify your Open WebUI URL is correct and accessible
- Check that your API key is valid
- Ensure CORS is properly configured on your Open WebUI instance
- Check the browser console for specific error messages

### Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working

- Some websites may intercept keyboard shortcuts
- Try on a different page or website
- Ensure no other extensions are conflicting with the shortcuts

### Models Not Loading

- Verify your API key has the correct permissions
- Check that your Open WebUI instance is running and accessible
- Ensure the `/api/models` endpoint is available

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 88+ (Manifest V3 support required)
- Edge 88+ (Chromium-based)
- Other Chromium-based browsers with Manifest V3 support

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- `storage` - To save your Open WebUI configuration
- `scripting` - To interact with web pages and inject content
- `host_permissions: <all_urls>` - To work on all websites
- Content scripts on all URLs - To provide the search interface
